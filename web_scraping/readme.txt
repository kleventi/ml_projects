In this project we will get data from a table in a web page, manipulate it, save it to a dataframe and finally to a csv file for 
future use. For this purpose we will use requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

The data is about "What Women Earn by Race/Ethnicity in the USA" and are taken from the below link:
